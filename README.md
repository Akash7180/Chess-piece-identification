## Chess Piece Identification using CNN - README

This repository contains code for identifying chess pieces using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to classify images of chess pieces into their respective types.

### Repository Contents

- **Chess-piece-identification**: This folder contains the code for the chess piece classification project. It includes the implementation of the CNN model and the necessary scripts for training and testing.

### Getting Started

To get started with the chess piece identification project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Akash7180/Chess-piece-identification.git`
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Prepare the dataset: The dataset should be organized into three folders - `train`, `valid`, and `test`. Each folder should contain an `images` folder with the chess piece images and a `labels` folder with the corresponding labels.
4. Train the model: Use the provided scripts to train the CNN model on the dataset.
5. Test the model: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the test dataset.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is not specified in the repository. However, other projects have used datasets such as the Chess Dataset[2] and a dataset consisting of nearly 55,000 images of chess pieces[4].

### Model Architecture

The chess piece identification model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial dependencies in the data[2]. The specific architecture used in this project may vary, depending on the implementation.
